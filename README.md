## Overview

This repository houses the websites for the Pepe Emoji Discord network. Notably, the [pepemanager.com] and [pepe-is.life] websites.

---

### Local setup

This setup assumes you have [Git], and [Node.js] setup on your machine. This repository requires [Node.js] version 16 or higher. This repository uses the [Yarn 3] package manager, so you should have basic knowledge about how to use it. It also uses [yarn workspaces] to manage both websites from the root directory.

#### Cloning repository

- `git clone git@github.com:almeidx/pepe-website.git`
- `cd pepe-website`
- `yarn`

Note: If you don't have yarn installed globally, you'll have to run `npm i -g yarn`.

#### Running the websites

- To start the bot website: `yarn bot dev`
- To start the main website: `yarn main dev`

Note: Most features of the websites require an API instance running, which is currently not publicly available.

### Deployment

The deployment of the websites is all automated by [Vercel]
