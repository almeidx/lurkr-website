## Embed Level up Messages

8 July 2024

### Dashboard

- Added the ability to create **Embed Messages** as the Level Up Message!
	- You can now create embed messages _in addition_ to the normal level up message that gets sent!
	- You can now remove the Level Up Message entirely in order to replace it with an embed message.
	- <u>Currently this feature is only available on the Dashboard!</u>
	- Thank you everyone for suggesting this feature!

- Added the abilities to preview **Embed Messages** when using the `/test` command!
	- Embeds are hard! Preview what your level up message will look like using `/test type:XP Message`

- Added a cookie pop-up box. Just click it away!
- Updated our Privacy Policy and Terms of Conditions to be more legible and concise. We haven't really touched the contents.

## Background Blacklist and Import Bots

27 June 2024

### Discord Bot

- Added a blacklisting system for users who upload innapropriate Backgrounds using `/background set`.
	- This is tied to the `/background report` command.
	- After reporting someone, our Team reviews the report and may delete the background & blacklist the reported user if necessary.

- Allowed separate role reward levels to share the same roles

- Fixed a bug with deleted users when importing leveling data from MEE6
- Fixed emojis not being displayed properly in some commands
- Fixed `/colour` command showing erroneous responses
- Fixed duplicate level up messages
- Fixed emoji-list deleting a very large amount of messages
- Fixed XP Multipliers showing duplicated roles at times
- Fixed `/importxp` for AmariBot only importing the first 50 members
- Stability improvements and other minor bug fixes

### Dashboard

- Added the `Import Bots` section to the Dashboard!  :icons_image:
	- Adds the same functionality as the `/importxp` command but in the nice brand new website!
	- Now shows the progress of the import, useful for large servers!
	- Currently only supports AmariBot and MEE6, let us know which Bots you want us to support next!
	- AtlasBot was removed due to them changing the way their API works.

- Fixed a bunch of styling & scaling issues primarily on Mobile
- Fixed a bug allowing non-selectable roles to be selected in dropdown menus

## New Website

26 June 2024

### Dashboard

2 Months ago we announced the launch of our new Beta website we've been crunching out for 2 Years! We're glad and
<u>(slightly)</u> relieved to announce it is, as of right now live and accessible from https://lurkr.gg/ directly!

- **Features!**
	- With the website now out, we can focus more on new features, both for the brand new and still shiny website and for
	the actual bot!

- **Feedback!**
	- We'd still love to hear your feedback and ideas! Drop a suggestion into #suggestions with the Website/Dashboard tag!

- üêõ **Stragglers**
	- Thank you for all of your contributions in finding and reporting bugs in the Beta website, though we're sure there
	are still more bugs to squash!
	- If you did find one, head over to support, create a forum post as usual detailing every step you took to reproduce
	the bug (In as much detail as possible!), the operating system you're on (Mac, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android), what
	device you're on (Mobile, Laptop, Desktop), what browser you're using (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and lastly, select the
	Website/Dashboard tag!
