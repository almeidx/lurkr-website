## Leveling System Settings on Leaderboard endpoint

Date: 2025-07-18

We've added the newly introduced leveling system settings to the `GET /levels/{guildId}` endpoint.
These settings are:

- `xpGainInterval` - The interval in seconds at which users gain experience.
- `xpPerMessageMax` - The maximum experience a user can gain per message.
- `xpPerMessageMin` - The minimum experience a user can gain per message.

## Public leaderboard endpoint

Date: 2025-05-04

We're making public an endpoint for retrieving the leaderboard of a server. This endpoint is available to all users,
and it does not require authentication:

- `GET /levels/{guildId}?page=1` - Get the leaderboard for a server.

Additionally, we've removed the `user.locale` property from the body of the `POST /levels/{guildId}/users/{userId}`
endpoint, and strictened the `user.avatar` schema, to ensure only a valid Discord avatar hash can be passed.

## Initial release

Date: 2025-04-27

Introducing the public Lurkr API. Starting with version 2.
