## Public leaderboard endpoint

Date: 2025-05-04

We're making public an endpoint for retrieving the leaderboard of a server. This endpoint is available to all users,
and it does not require authentication:

- `GET /levels/{guildId}?page=1` - Get the leaderboard for a server.

Additionally, we've removed the `user.locale` property from the body of the `POST /levels/{guildId}/users/{userId}`
endpoint, and strictened the `user.avatar` schema, to ensure only a valid Discord avatar hash can be passed.

## Initial release

Date: 2025-04-27

Introducing the public Lurkr API. Starting with version 2.

Public endpoints included with this release:

- `GET /levels/{guildId}/users/{userId}` - Get a user's experience on a server.
- `POST /levels/{guildId}/users/{userId}` - Create a new leveling entry for a user on a server.
- `PATCH /levels/{guildId}/users/{userId}` - Update a user's experience on a server.
- `DELETE /levels/{guildId}/users/{userId}` - Delete a user's level entry on a server.
