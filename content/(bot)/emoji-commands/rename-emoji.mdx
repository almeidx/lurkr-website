# Rename Emoji



### Description

This command can be used to rename emojis or emotes on your server. It is most useful on mobile devices where the Discord User Interface can be a bit clunky and hard to navigate, although the command works perfectly fine on desktop and browser versions.

You can only input an emoji that already has been successfully created. The emoji does not have to be made using Pepe Manager, the command will also rename emojis uploaded by other bots or users.

You can only rename your own server emojis, and not emojis uploaded onto other servers, even if the server in question also has Pepe Manager.
