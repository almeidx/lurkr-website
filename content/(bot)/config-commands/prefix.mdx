# Prefix

### Description

This command can be used to set a new prefix for Pepe Manager, if the default prefix **p!** clashes with other bots you may have in your server.  
  
After you have set your server specific prefix, the default prefix will no longer work. If you have forgotten what you set your prefix to, you can simply mention Pepe Manager, \(**@Pepe Manager**\) and it will tell you what it is set to.

Alternatively, you can also replace the prefix with Pepe Manager's mention \(**@Pepe Manager**\). If you want to do this, put a space in between the mention and the command you want to execute.
