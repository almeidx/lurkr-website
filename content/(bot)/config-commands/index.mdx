This command can be used to configure how Lurkr behaves in your server. Most, if not all of the settings you can change about Lurkr can be done through the configuration command.

The config command has 6 **methods**, or ways to interact with the command. These are represented as sub-commands. Within each **method** you have different **options** which correspond to the major features that you can configure in Lurkr. Once you've select the method and option, you can then set an option, which is the specific setting you want to configure.
