## Leveling Roles aren't being Assigned!

If you think you have set up the Leveling roles correctly, but users aren't getting them when they level up or when they
use the `/syncrolerewards` command, follow these steps in order to fix your issue! These steps are also the same when
troubleshooting the Top Leveling role.

### 1. Make sure the bot has 'Manage roles' permission

The bot needs to have this permission in order to assign roles. If you're new to Discord, a lot of different permissions
are bundled under one permission umbrella, and giving the manage roles permission also grants users access to assign
roles.

### 2. Make sure the roles you want to assign are below the bot on the role list

Another common issue is that the bot **DOES** have the manage roles permission, but the highest bot role (ie. The
top-most role that the bot is assigned to) is lower down in the role-ranking than the roles you want it to assign.
Hierarchy moves from the top to the bottom, so make sure that the bot always has a role that's above the Leveling roles.

### 3. Make sure the roles you want to assign aren't integration managed

Integration managed means that the role you want to assign is being used by an external bot or integration.
[This](/static/docs/integration-managed-role.png) is what you will see at the top of the role edit page when the role is
managed by an integration.

### 4. It's still not working!

If the bot still isn't assigning the Leveling roles, join our support server and create a post in our support forum
channel. Make sure to include all of your troubleshooting steps and screenshots!
