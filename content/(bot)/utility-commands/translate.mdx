### Description

This command can let you translate text directly within Discord using the Google Translate services. 

It can automatically detect which language you want to have translated and by default will translate it into English.

### Command Structure

```
/translate <text:> [source_language:] [target_language:]
```

If the auto-detection doesn't work reliably, you can always manually set the source and target language with the `source_language:` and `target_language:` options.
