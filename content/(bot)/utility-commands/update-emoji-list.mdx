# Update Emoji List

### Description

This command can be used to force the bot to update the emoji list if one is configured. If you do not have one configured yet, please refer to the [Automatically Controlled Emoji-List](../guides/automatically-controlled-emoji-list.md) guide.

The emoji list will try to update as fast as the API will allow it, but depending on how many emojis you have in your server it might take more or less time than usual.
