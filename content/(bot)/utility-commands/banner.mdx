# Banner

### Description

This command can be used to display the profile banner of yourself or of other users. You can change the size of the banner that is displayed and even change the format in which it's saved, useful for example for converting GIF banners to still images.

The command can fetch the banner of any user on Discord as long as you provide it with a User ID if the user is not in a shared server.\
\
If the user doesn't have a custom banner to be displayed, their profile accent colour will be displayed as a banner image instead.
