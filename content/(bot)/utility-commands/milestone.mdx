# Milestone

### Description

This command can be used to display the information associated with a specific milestone that your server has achieved in the past.

You need to have [member milestones](../guides/automatically-controlled-member-milestones.md) already setup and have achieved a milestone already for this command to work.

When you enter a milestone that you have previously achieved the bot will respond with the exact member count that was achieved, the member who is considered as the 'milestone member', and the exact time and date when said milestone was achieved.
