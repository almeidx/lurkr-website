# Random
### Description

<Callout type="warning">
This is a **method** or **sub-command** of the [Emoji](./) command. It is not its own command.
</Callout>

This command can be used to find a random emoji in your server for the sheer fun of it. Perhaps play a game of "First to find the special emojis wins something". ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

It can only select a random emoji from your current server and not from all servers that Lurkr is in. It will also not select an emoji from the default Discord emojis.
