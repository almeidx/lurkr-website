### Description

<Callout type="warning">
	This is a **method** or **sub-command** of the [Emoji](./) command. It is not its own command.
</Callout>

This command can be used to delete emojis or emotes on your server. It is most useful on mobile devices where the
Discord User Interface can be a bit clunky and hard to navigate, although the command works perfectly fine on desktop
and browser versions.

You can only input an emoji that already has been successfully created. The emoji does not have to be made using Lurkr,
the command will also delete emojis uploaded by other bots or users.

You can only delete your own server emojis, and not emojis uploaded onto other servers, even if the server in question
also has Lurkr.
