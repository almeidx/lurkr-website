# Emoji

### Description

The emoji command allows you to create, delete, download, search and pick a random emoji within your server! It is most useful on Discord Mobile where the UI might be a little clunky and hard to navigate, making slash commands easier and more convenient to use.

The emoji command has 5 **methods**, or ways to interact with the command. These are represented as sub-commands. Within each **method** you have different **options** which correspond to the major emoji features that you can use with Lurkr. Once you've select the method and option, you can then set an option to use.
