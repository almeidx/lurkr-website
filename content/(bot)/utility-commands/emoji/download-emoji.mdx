# Download
### Description

<Callout type="warning">
This is a **method** or **sub-command** of the [Emoji](./) command. It is not its own command.
</Callout>

This command can be used to download emojis or emotes from your server or other servers. Lurkr does not need to be in the same server as the emoji in order to download it.

As well as custom emojis, Lurkr can also download default emojis through the Discord emoji menu. Custom emojis and default emojis can be combined in the same download request.

The command can process up to 9 emojis at a time, although there is no strict limit on how many emojis you can download in total.
