### Description

<Callout type="warning">
This is a **method** or **sub-command** of the [Emoji](./) command. It is not its own command.
</Callout>

This command can be used to search for a custom emoji within a server using keywords. This is useful if there are a lot of emojis in a single server (With boost levels) or if many emojis looks very similar in the emoji-picker.

This command will not search through default Discord emojis and will also not search through other custom emojis from other servers, even if you are the owner of them too.\
\
The search is a loose match, meaning that the letters in the keyword must in the correct order for the emoji to be a match, but the keyword you enter can be located anywhere in the emoji name itself. The search will only work with Alphanumeric characters (Letters and numbers).
