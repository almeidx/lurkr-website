# Growth Change

### Description

This command can be used to visualize the **change** in user growth on your server over time. You can change the number of days the graph displays with the `days:` option.

Note that the bot can only display user growth while it is in your server. As long as it isn't in your server it cannot track users in any way.&#x20;

Please also note that by toggling the configuration option `Member Join/Leave Tracking` it will prevent the bot from tracking users even while it is still in the server.\
\
This command is different from the [`membergraph`](member-graph.md)command because it shows the change in user growth, not the total overall growth. In this case, the graph can be negative if you lose more users than you gain.
