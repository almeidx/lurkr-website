# Level Role

### Description

This command can be used to add levels to a user equal to the amount of levels they would need in order to gain the specified **role reward**.&#x20;

This command works both for adding levels and for removing levels to get to the specified role reward.

If you have role reward stacking enabled, this will also give them all role rewards up to the one you specified in the command.

If you want to add levels to a user that already has some, you can use the [level add](level-add.md) command
