# Leaderboard

### Description

This command can be used to view the leveling leaderboard for the server that you're in. The leaderboard will only show up if the server has leveling enabled and if there are users who have already earned levelsin the appropriate channels.&#x20;

The embedded message will add ◀ and ▶ buttons, which when pressed by the command author allows you to turn to the next leaderboard page. A total of 10 users can be listed on the same page, and are shown what level they are and how much levels they have gained.

You can see as many leaderboard entries as your current server plan will allow. You can check the limits on the Patreon Perks page!
