# Level Add

### Description

This command can be used to give a user levels on demand. The user you want to add levels to does not need to have prior levels. If the user you want to add levels to does however have prior levels, the levels you specify in the command will be added to their current levels.

If you want to set a user to a specific level without adding to what they already have, you can use the [level set](level-set.md) command
