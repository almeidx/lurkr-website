# Customize Leveling Speed

## How does Lurkr give out XP?

Before you change the leveling speed of your server, it is important to understand how Lurkr gives out XP.

By default, if someone sends a message in a [channel that allows Leveling](/bot/guides/setting-up-server-leveling), Lurkr will give them a random amount of XP ranging between 15 and 40 XP

After that, a cooldown of 1 minute is applied during which time any other messages the user may send, doesn't gain them any more XP.

## How to change the Leveling Speed?

In order to set your new leveling speed, go to your [servers dashboard](https://lurkr.gg/guilds) and select the **Leveling** category.

Scroll down to the **System Settings** section. There you can change the cooldown between each XP-earning message and the range of XP users will be randomly given.

If you want your users to gain a **fixed** amount of XP per message, set the minimum and maximum XP to the same number. Otherwise, make sure that the maximum XP number is larger than the minimum XP number.
