## Why Would You Need This?

Well, we seriously hope you really really **DON'T** need this, surprisingly! We want to make Lurkr as accessible, feature-full and easy to use as no bot before it!

The reason we implemented an export feature is to essentially **not be an asshole** and lock you dear user into a bot that you realistically cannot remove without great detriment to your community by taking away all of the months or even years of leveling grinding your users have already done.

## Guide

### How to Export

Exporting your server's leveling data is super easy. You need to either be a server manager (Have the `Manage Server` permission) or be the server owner, and access the dashboard which you can do through [this link](/guilds). Log in with your Discord account if you are prompted to do so.

Once in the dashboard, select the server you want to export the leveling data from, from the tiled array of servers you are allowed to manage. On the left hand side you should be able to see the different sections of the dashboard. Click on the one marked `‚ö†Ô∏è Danger Zone`, and on the following page click on the button labeled `Download Leveling Data`.

Once you've saved the file on your local computer or phone, you've successfully exported the leveling data!

<Callout type="info">
    Downloading your leveling data **DOES NOT** delete your leveling data. It creates a copy of the leveling data at the time you request it and saves it seperately to your computer.

    If you do want to delete your leveling data as well, you can use the [/config deleteall](../config-commands/config/delete-all.md) command or the `Reset Settings` button in the Danger Zone section of the dashboard.

### File Structure

Below is an example of what the file structure of your leveling leaderboard export will look like. It is now up to you what you want to do with your data!

```typescript
interface Level {
    avatar: string | null;
    level: number;
    messageCount: number;
    tag: string | null;
    userId: string;
    xp: number;
}

interface Export {
    levels: Level[];
}
```
