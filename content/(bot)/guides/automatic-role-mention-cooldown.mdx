## Why Would You Need This?

The main use-case of this feature is to have a moderator role mention cooldown.
Many servers like to keep their Moderator role mentionable in case some accident or disaster happens to keep moderators
on stand-by ASAP. However, if this power is given to too many people, eventually there will be people who abuse this and
spam ping moderators constantly, even when there is no emergency.

## Guide

### Setting up the roles

In order to get started, first, you must set which roles will have a mention cooldown.

Typically, this will be the moderator role or the administrator role, however, it is entirely up to you which role(s) you decide to choose.

To set your role(s), type the following command. You can enter as many roles as your current server plan will allow.
You can check the limits on the Premium Perks page!

### Setting up the cooldown time

The cooldown time can be any time between **5 minutes** and **30 minutes**, and it is the time between when the role mention option is disabled after a mention in a channel to when it is re-enabled.

To set your cooldown time, type the following command:

	![Usage of the slash command '/config set option:Role Mention Cooldown Time'](../../_assets/setting-role-mention-cooldown-time.webp)
</center>

A modal-box will then appear, in which you can then enter the time interval you want to assign.
