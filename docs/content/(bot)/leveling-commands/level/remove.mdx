description: Remove levels from users.

### Description

This command can be used to remove a user's levels on demand.

The user you want to remove levels from **does** need to have prior levels.

The levels you specify in the command will be removed from their current levels.

### Command Structure

```
/level remove <user:> <amount:> [announce:]
```

The optional `announce` parameter allows you to control whether a level down announcement should be sent if the user loses a level as a result of this command (only applies if level up announcements are enabled on your server). By default, this is disabled.
