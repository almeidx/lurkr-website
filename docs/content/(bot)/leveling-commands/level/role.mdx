title: Level Role
description: Add levels to users based on role rewards.
---

### Description

This command can be used to add levels to a user equal to the amount of levels they would need in order to gain the
specified **role reward**.

This command works both for adding levels and for removing levels to get to the specified role reward.

If you have role reward stacking enabled, this will also give them all role rewards up to the one you specified in the
command.

If you want to add levels to a user that already has some, you can use the [level add](./add) command

### Command Structure

```
/level role <user:> <reward:> [announce:]
```

| announce | Whether to announce the level up in the designated channel (only if leveling up occurs) | No       |

The optional `announce` parameter allows you to control whether a level up announcement should be sent if the user
levels up as a result of this command (only applies if level up announcements are enabled on your server). By default,
this is disabled.
