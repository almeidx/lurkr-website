### Description

<Callout type="warning">
	This is a **method** or **sub-command** of the [Background ](./)command. It is not its own command.
</Callout>

This method of the [background ](./)command can be used to report other users if the background they have set for their
leveling card is inappropriate in some way.

Reported backgrounds are sent to the Lurkr Support Team to be reviewed individually by humans. If the reported image is
found to be violating the Discord Terms of Service and/or fit the descriptions of the report reasons below, it will be
deleted and the default leveling background will be put in it's place for that user.

Repeat offenders might be banned from using the bot globally on any server it is used.
