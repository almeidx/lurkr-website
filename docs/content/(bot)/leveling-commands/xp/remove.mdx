### Description

This command can be used to remove a user's XP on demand.

The user you want to remove XP from **does** need to have prior XP.

The XP you specify in the command will be removed from their current XP.

### Command Structure

```
/xp remove <user:> <amount:> [announce:]
```

The optional `announce` parameter allows you to control whether a level down announcement should be sent if the user loses a level as a result of this command (only applies if level up announcements are enabled on your server). By default, this is disabled.

### Permission

- `Manage Server` **(User)**
- N/A **(Bot)**
