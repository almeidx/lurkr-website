### Description

This command can be used to set a user's XP on demand.

The user you want to set XP to does not need to have prior XP.

If the user you want to set XP to does however have prior XP, their existing XP will be replaced with the new one.

If you want to add XP to a user that already has some, you can use the [xp add](./add) command

### Command Structure

```
/xp set <user:> <amount:> [announce:]
```

The optional `announce` parameter allows you to control whether a level up announcement should be sent if the user levels up as a result of this command (only applies if level up announcements are enabled on your server). By default, this is disabled.

### Permission

- `Manage Server` **(User)**
- N/A **(Bot)**
