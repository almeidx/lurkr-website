### Description

This command allows you to control your privacy on public Lurkr leaderboards. When enabled, your data will be anonymized on all public leaderboards, helping you maintain your privacy while still participating in server leveling.

This privacy setting does not affect Members-only or Managers-only leaderboards, only public leaderboards that are accessible to everyone.

It might take a few minutes for the effects to become visible after changing your privacy settings.
