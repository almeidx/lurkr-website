### Description

This command allows you to control your privacy settings on Lurkr. You can toggle the `leaderboard` privacy option to anonymize your data on all public leaderboards, helping you maintain your privacy while still participating in server leveling.

The leaderboard privacy setting does not affect Members-only or Managers-only leaderboards, only public leaderboards that are accessible to everyone.

It might take a few minutes for the effects to become visible after changing your privacy settings.
