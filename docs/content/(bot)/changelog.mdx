## Introducing the Lurkr API!

28 April 2025

### Discord Bot [!toc]

- Added a **public API** for other developers to take advantage of Lurkr's deep Leveling System for their own projects!
  - This can allow you to add leveling requirements for your own bots, add or remove levels\/xp based on other factors,
    and integrate Lurkr leveling into other games!
  - You can create and customize your API key on your profile page: [lurkr.gg/profile](/profile)
  - Please read the API Documentation before creating support requests: [lurkr.gg/docs/api](/docs/api)

- Improved and updated the rank card!
  - Now applies the name on the rank card in this order: <u>1.</u> Nickname, <u>2.</u> Display name, <u>3.</u> Username
  - Removed the character limit for names on the rank card.
  - Removed the dark gray background around the Avatar in the rank card.

- Added the `level_or_milestone` option to the `/test` command.
  - Useful for checking how the level up message or milestone message will look like for specific levels or milestones.

- Fixed the rank card not showing when any image failed to load.
- Fixed cyrillic alphabet not appearing in the rank card.

### Dashboard [!toc]

- Added an API key generation section to the profile page! [lurkr.gg/profile](/profile)

## Role Rewards placeholder on Level Up Messages

30 December 2024

### Discord Bot [!toc]

- Added `{roleRewards}` placeholder to Level Up Message!
  - This now allows you to show which role rewards your members get!
  - Also added support for showing text conditionally, using `{#var}text here{/var}` and `{^var}text here{/var}` for
    negative condition.
  - **For Example**: `{#roleRewards}You gained the {roleRewards} role rewards!{/roleRewards}`, this **only appears if**
    role rewards were applied.

- Added support for more colour names in the `/colour` command

- Fixed an issue with the handling of Polaris private leaderboard errors.
- Fixed only one mentioned role working at a time for mentioned role cooldowns.
- Minor stability improvements.

- Removed `/image`, `/purge`, and `/translate` commands.
  - They are no longer the focus of the bot, and weren't used by anyone anymore.

### Dashboard [!toc]

- Fixed a 404 error when accepting cookies in the dashboard page.
- Fixed roles not being saved when updating an existing role multiplier.

## Quality of Life Improvements

29 September 2024

### Discord Bot [!toc]

- Increased the Role Mention Cooldown interval to **6 Hours** for [Lurkr Ultimate](/premium) servers.
  - The standard limit of 30 minutes has not been changed.

- Added a `user` option to `/background view` command.
  - This new option is meant to help users find and report (`/background report`) offensive user backgrounds.

- Added named colour options to the `/colour` command.
  - This means you can now type `red` or `green` instead of a complicated hex code! Give it a try!

- Fixed Polaris Import importing incorrect levels.
- Reduced probability of getting an "unexpected error" when using `/importxp`.
- Renamed the `until` option in the `/importxp` command to `min_level` for better clarity on what the option does.
- Fixed an issue not gaining XP when an active multiplier is too low (ie. x0.01).

- Unfortunately Polaris Import's might still sometimes fail with "unexpected errors". This is because of Polaris'
  inherent instability and cannot be fixed on our end.

### Dashboard [!toc]

- Added a toggle for **Only Announce Level-Ups Together With Role Rewards** which was previously only available through
  the config command.
  - You can find it under **Leveling > Level Up Message**.

- Added showing the non-shortened number when hovering over it in the Leveling Calculator.
  - Instead of `21.3M`, hovering over the number with your mouse will show `21,303,511` now.

- Fixed level up message conditions not showing/updating correctly.
- Miscellaneous styling fixes.

## Polaris Leaderboard Import

24 August 2024

### Discord Bot [!toc]

- Added [Polaris](https://gdcolon.com/polaris/) support to the Import Bots section in the dashboard & `/importxp`
  command!
  - Polaris has been discontinued by the creator, and we want to help server owners/admins enjoy a smooth transition to
    our leveling bot
  - Polaris import supports Role Rewards!

- Changed the `/colour` error message to better communicate hex colour codes.
- Fixed the very first message a user sends not counting towards their XP but still triggering the XP cooldown.

### Dashboard [!toc]

- Fixed several errors when saving changes on the leveling page of the dashboard.

## Embed Level up Messages

8 July 2024

### Dashboard [!toc]

- Added the ability to create **Embed Messages** as the Level Up Message!
  - You can now create embed messages _in addition_ to the normal level up message that gets sent!
  - You can now remove the Level Up Message entirely in order to replace it with an embed message.
  - <u>Currently this feature is only available on the Dashboard!</u>
  - Thank you everyone for suggesting this feature!

- Added the abilities to preview **Embed Messages** when using the `/test` command!
  - Embeds are hard! Preview what your level up message will look like using `/test type:XP Message`

- Added a cookie pop-up box. Just click it away!
- Updated our Privacy Policy and Terms of Conditions to be more legible and concise. We haven't really touched the
  contents.

## Background Blacklist and Import Bots

27 June 2024

### Discord Bot [!toc]

- Added a blacklisting system for users who upload innapropriate Backgrounds using `/background set`.
  - This is tied to the `/background report` command.
  - After reporting someone, our Team reviews the report and may delete the background & blacklist the reported user if
    necessary.

- Allowed separate role reward levels to share the same roles

- Fixed a bug with deleted users when importing leveling data from MEE6
- Fixed emojis not being displayed properly in some commands
- Fixed `/colour` command showing erroneous responses
- Fixed duplicate level up messages
- Fixed emoji-list deleting a very large amount of messages
- Fixed XP Multipliers showing duplicated roles at times
- Fixed `/importxp` for AmariBot only importing the first 50 members
- Stability improvements and other minor bug fixes

### Dashboard [!toc]

- Added the `Import Bots` section to the Dashboard!
  - Adds the same functionality as the `/importxp` command but in the nice brand new website!
  - Now shows the progress of the import, useful for large servers!
  - Currently only supports AmariBot and MEE6, let us know which Bots you want us to support next!
  - AtlasBot was removed due to them changing the way their API works.

- Fixed a bunch of styling & scaling issues primarily on Mobile
- Fixed a bug allowing non-selectable roles to be selected in dropdown menus

## New Website

26 June 2024

### Dashboard [!toc]

2 Months ago we announced the launch of our new Beta website we've been crunching out for 2 Years! We're glad and

<u>(slightly)</u> relieved to announce it is, as of right now live and accessible from https://lurkr.gg/ directly!

- **Features!**
  - With the website now out, we can focus more on new features, both for the brand new and still shiny website and for
    the actual bot!

- **Feedback!**
  - We'd still love to hear your feedback and ideas! Drop a suggestion into #suggestions with the Website/Dashboard tag!

- üêõ **Stragglers**
  - Thank you for all of your contributions in finding and reporting bugs in the Beta website, though we're sure there
    are still more bugs to squash!
  - If you did find one, head over to support, create a forum post as usual detailing every step you took to reproduce
    the bug (In as much detail as possible!), the operating system you're on (Mac, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android), what
    device you're on (Mobile, Laptop, Desktop), what browser you're using (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and lastly, select
    the Website/Dashboard tag!
