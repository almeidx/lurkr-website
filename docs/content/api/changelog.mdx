## Get Role Rewards Changes for a Specific Level

Date: 2025-10-13

The global rate limit has been raised from **60** to **1500 requests per minute**.

Added a new endpoint to fetch the changes in Role Reward roles for a specific level and user:

- [`GET /guilds/{guildId}/role-rewards/level`](endpoints/guilds/get-the-role-rewards-changes-for-a-specific-level)

## Leveling System Settings on Leaderboard endpoint

Date: 2025-07-18

We've added the newly introduced leveling system settings to the
[`GET /levels/{guildId}`](endpoints/levels/get-leaderboard) endpoint. These settings are:

- `xpGainInterval` - The interval in seconds at which users gain experience.
- `xpPerMessageMax` - The maximum experience a user can gain per message.
- `xpPerMessageMin` - The minimum experience a user can gain per message.

## Public leaderboard endpoint

Date: 2025-05-04

We're making public an endpoint for retrieving the leaderboard of a server. This endpoint is available to all users, and
it does not require authentication:

- [`GET /levels/{guildId}?page=1`](./endpoints/levels/get-leaderboard) - Get the leaderboard for a server.

Additionally, we've removed the `user.locale` property from the body of the
[`POST /levels/{guildId}/users/{userId}`](endpoints/levels/create-user-level) endpoint, and strictened the `user.avatar`
schema, to ensure only a valid Discord avatar hash can be passed.
